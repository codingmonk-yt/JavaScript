## Code Structure: Building Blocks of Your Code

**1. Statements:**

* These are the building blocks of code that perform actions.
* Example: `alert('Hello, world!')` displays the message "Hello, world!".
* You can have many statements, separated by semicolons (`;`).

**2. Semicolons:**

* Semicolons are used to terminate statements. 
* In most cases, a newline acts as an implicit semicolon, but it's safer to use them explicitly for better readability.
* **Caution:** Newlines might not always imply a semicolon, which can lead to errors.

**3. Comments:**

* Comments are explanations added to code to clarify its purpose.
* They are ignored by the computer but essential for human understanding.
* There are two types of comments:
    * Single-line comments: Start with `//` (e.g., `// This is a comment`)
    * Multi-line comments: Enclosed between `/*` and `*/` (e.g., 
      ```
      /* This is a multiline comment
       * It can span multiple lines
       */
      ```
* Use comments liberally to improve code readability and maintainability.

**Key Points:**

* Always use semicolons between statements for better practice.
* Comments won't affect how the code runs but are crucial for understanding.
* Comments can be temporarily used to disable code sections.
